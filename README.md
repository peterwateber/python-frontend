# Explanation


### Framework
I was deciding whether to use ReactJS and Typescript but it seems like the project setup is too simple. So, I don't want to make it complicated; I used HTML and JS instead.

### Language
JS
- it is simple and since highcharts.js is using javascript.


### Design

- Strength
    - I am not really familiar with how this information is being perceived to the user's point of view. I am trying to understand how this works. It seems like the only way for me to understand is to keep it simple. The representation would give you the accumulated `sample index`, `sensor values`, and `unique class_label` from each sensor.

- Weaknesses
    - My understanding with the subject is very limited. I'm still trying to learn more. I could keep the sample size smaller so that it is easier to implement then I would merge all the `sensors` available.
